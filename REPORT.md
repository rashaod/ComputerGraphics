# Home-Gym Planner — Mini Project Report

> **Draft — reword in your own voice before submitting.**

## The question this project answers

*"I want to put a treadmill, a squat rack and a bench in my room. Will it all fit — with enough safe space around each piece to actually train?"*

The app lets you enter your room size, place gym equipment in 3D, and see which pieces fit, which collide, and where the ceiling is too low (for example for an overhead press). Every check is built from the geometric tests in the **Basic Geometry** lecture, the equipment is built as meshes following the **Mesh Modeling** lecture, and it is lit with our own shader that implements the **Illumination Models & Shading** lecture.

**How it differs from the homework (nanorender):** the homework is a viewer for *one* loaded model. This project is a scene with *many* objects, and its main job is to *measure* the space between them and give an answer (fits / does not fit). It is written in TypeScript and runs in the browser.

**Tools:** TypeScript, Vite (dev server), three.js (WebGL drawing and camera orbit only).

## Part 1 — The room

### Approach
- The room is described by three numbers, `length` (X), `width` (Z) and `height` (Y), in **centimetres** (1 unit = 1 cm), stored in a `Room` object (`src/room.ts`). Using real units from the start means every later distance check prints a number the user understands ("12 cm to the ceiling").
- The room's corner sits at the origin, so the floor is the rectangle `0..length × 0..width` on `y = 0` and the ceiling is the plane `y = height`. Later parts use exactly these planes for the point–plane distance test (Basic Geometry, slide 20).
- Only the two back walls are drawn solid; the front walls and ceiling are drawn as an outline, so the inside of the room is never hidden.
- A floor grid with one line every 50 cm lets the reader estimate sizes directly from a screenshot.
- Three sliders change the size. On every change the room's meshes are thrown away and rebuilt (simple, and fast enough for a handful of meshes).
- Camera: a perspective camera (the same idea as the perspective projection we built in hw3) with three.js `OrbitControls` to orbit/zoom/pan. We deliberately use the library here: camera navigation was already implemented by hand in hw3, so re-writing it would repeat the homework instead of adding something new.

### Result
![Default room, 400 × 350 × 250 cm](./assets/part1_room.png)

*Default room: 400 × 350 × 250 cm. Each grid square is 50 × 50 cm.*

![Room resized with the sliders to 600 × 350 × 320 cm](./assets/part1_room_resized.png)

*The same view after changing length to 600 cm and height to 320 cm with the sliders.*

### Limitations
- The surfaces use a flat colour with no lighting yet (`MeshBasicMaterial`); this is replaced by our own Phong shader in Part 2.
- The room is always a rectangular box — no L-shaped rooms, doors or windows.
- The camera does not re-frame itself when the room grows; the user zooms out with the mouse wheel.
